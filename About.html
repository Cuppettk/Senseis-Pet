<h3>About Sensei's Pet</h3>

<p>
  Senseis pet is a program of necessity. It was designed primarily for use by Assistant Language
  Teachers working abroad as a tool to brighten up what is often monotonous, dull, and routine
  language practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  This program, however, is certainly usable by many other's in a situation where the only way
  to thoroughly memorize something is through repitition. If you're going to have to repeat 
  something over and over again, you might as well make it fun. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The various tools should help streamline the process from lesson planning to execution.

<h3>About the Creator</h3>

<p>
	This guy is crazy. He really thinks that he is going to follow through on certain "projects" that 
	he continually starts and can never seem to finish. He's such a douchebag.
